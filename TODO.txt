1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority


Features
--------
[✔] New Monster Building: Sculk Catalyst
    - Like in vanilla, nearby units which die spread sculk blocks
    - Extends night range in a 25-block radius, which can be extended up to 40 blocks with more sculk
    - When attacked, destroys nearby sculk blocks before taking damage (effectively giving it +1 hp per sculk)
    - Can be upgraded at a Lab (with a Stronghold) to allow wardens to split sonic booms into 3 random nearby enemies


Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed a crash when using the idle workers button. Thanks @Boobcat
[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam
[✔] The hotkey for bridges has been changed to G to avoid an overlap with Build/Repair
[✔] Fixed a crash when you build over a ledge with no floor
[✔] Podzol, mud, moss and mycelium now convert to nether terrain (as nylium)
[✔] Changed bridge hotkey again to C as G also was taken
[✔] Added a hard stop on opening the creative menu while in F12 cam

Quality of Life Features
------------------------
[✔] Tree logs now become affected by gravity whenever any log is broken
    - This applies to all log blocks, wood blocks and nether stems
    - this is enabled by default but can be toggled using /gamerule doLogFalling
[✔] make /rts-fog serverside (no warnings)
[✔] Sources of night warping now have a range indicator, toggleable by clicking the clock, and the exact range is written next to the building name

Balancing
---------
[✔] Capitols now spawn animals closer and immediately spawn some nearby upon being built (within a 40 block radius)
