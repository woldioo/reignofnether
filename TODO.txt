1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority


Features
--------
[❌] New Monster Building: Sculk Catalyst
    - Like in vanilla, nearby units which die spread sculk blocks
    - Extends night range in a 25-block radius, which can be extended up to 40 blocks with more sculk
    - When attacked, destroys nearby sculk blocks before taking damage (effectively giving it +1 hp sculk)
    - Can be upgraded at a Lab (with a Stronghold) to allow wardens to split sonic booms into 3 random nearby enemies

[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam
[✔] The hotkey for bridges has been changed to G to avoid an overlap with Build/Repair

Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] Sources of night warping now have a range indicator, toggleable by clicking the clock, and the exact range is written next to the building name
